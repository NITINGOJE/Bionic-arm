Bionic arm:
There are many accidents that occur in our day-to-day lives. As a result, they may cause the loss of particular limbs, which makes life difficult for people after amputation.
Additionally, there are diseases such as carpal tunnel syndrome, which can lead to a loss of hand functionality. 
A prosthetic arm is a useful solution for providing an artificial limb for disabled people. However, many existing solutions lack in certain areas. 
Our project, named BIONIC ARM, is low in cost and has a soft part for holding the hand.
